[Artistree](https://artistree-78c6a.web.app/) is a web app that allows artists to connect with their audience in an easy and interactive way.

Due to the pandemic, a lot of artists have lost their revenue: musicians are unable to book gigs; visual artists have no one to sell their pieces to; street performers have no tourists with whom to share their talents.
It’s been a hard time for artists around the globe, and a hard time for us all to appreciate and support art.

ArtistTree provides this bridge between artists and their audience where they’re able to perform, receiving adequate compensation and attention. 
Imagine booking a class with a painter you look up to, or being able to talk to and get feedback from that graphic artist you follow. 

###ArtisTree will let the artistic world flourish!

Note: this concept was developed under the User-Centered Design Course at [Instituto Superior Técnico](www.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).
